# Prakriti Ayurveda - Natural Skincare Website

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my hackathon submission - a modern website for an Ayurvedic skincare startup called "Prakriti Ayurveda". I wanted to create something that feels both professional and genuinely connected to nature, which is why I went with a green color palette and natural themes throughout.

## What's This About?

Prakriti Ayurveda is a fictional startup that brings ancient Ayurvedic wisdom to modern skincare. The website showcases their natural products, expert team, and commitment to pure ingredients. I built this as part of a hackathon where we had to implement 4 specific interactive elements.

## The 4 Interactive Elements I Built

### 1. Split-Panel Navigation Menu
- **What it does**: Opens a full-screen overlay with a unique split design
- **Left panel**: Green background with the brand name and a subtle dot pattern
- **Right panel**: Clean white space with navigation items
- **Cool feature**: Each menu item has different hover colors (red, teal, blue, green)
- **Why I chose this**: It creates a memorable first impression and feels premium

### 2. Body-Level Ripple Effect
- **What it does**: Creates small, subtle ripples that follow your mouse movement
- **How it works**: Uses document-level event listeners to track mouse position
- **Visual style**: Soft green gradients that fade out quickly
- **Why I chose this**: Adds a touch of interactivity without being distracting

### 3. Product Image Marquee
- **What it does**: Shows a scrolling carousel of skincare products
- **Features**: Pauses on hover, glass-morphism design, larger images
- **Products shown**: Face creams, herbal soaps, essential oils, clay masks, body care, hair care
- **Why I chose this**: Perfect for showcasing product range in an engaging way

### 4. Full-Width Team Section
- **What it does**: Displays team members in connected bars that span the full width
- **Interactive element**: Hover over names to see circular profile photos
- **Team members**: Ayurvedic experts with relevant titles
- **Why I chose this**: Creates a sense of expertise and trust

## Technical Stuff

### Built With
- **React 18** with Vite for fast development
- **CSS3** with custom animations and gradients
- **JavaScript** for interactive elements
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices

### Key Features
- **Smooth animations** throughout the site
- **Glass-morphism effects** on product cards
- **Hover interactions** that feel natural
- **Green color scheme** (#2D5A27, #4A7C59) for natural vibes
- **Professional typography** with the Inter font family

## The Design Philosophy

I wanted this to feel like a real Ayurvedic skincare brand, so I:
- Used natural green colors instead of harsh blues or reds
- Added subtle animations that feel organic
- Included authentic product names and expert titles
- Made everything feel premium but approachable

## What Makes This Special

The website isn't just a collection of elements - it tells a story. From the hero section explaining ancient wisdom to the product showcase and expert team, everything flows together to create a cohesive brand experience.

The interactive elements aren't just for show either. The ripple effect adds a touch of magic, the marquee showcases products effectively, the navigation feels premium, and the team section builds trust. Each element serves a purpose while being fun to interact with.

## Running the Project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Final Thoughts

This was a really fun project to build! I love how the green color scheme and natural themes came together. The interactive elements feel organic rather than forced, which was exactly what I was going for. It's amazing how small details like the ripple effect or hover animations can make a website feel so much more alive.

The hackathon challenge of implementing 4 specific elements really pushed me to think creatively about how to make them work together as a cohesive experience rather than just checking boxes. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out! ðŸŒ¿âœ¨
